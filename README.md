# DC_Circuit_Solver
DC Circuit Solver is a comprehensive tool designed for solving and analyzing Direct Current (DC) electrical circuits.This project uses Incidence Matrix to compute node voltages.

Features
	Nodal Voltage Analysis : Accurately calculates node voltages at various circuit nodes
	Component Parameters : Includes Current source, Voltage Source and Resistors
	Netlist Builder : This project reads a given netlist to find nodal voltages
	
This project uses Eigen - A C++ template library for linear algebra
